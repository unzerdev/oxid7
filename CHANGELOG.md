We are excited to announce the release of the new Unzer Payment plugin for OXID eShop 7.

### 🔑 Key Features:

- **Integration with PayPage V2:** The plugin is integrated with Unzer’s PayPage V2 for an enhanced payment experience.
- **Plugin Implementation:** This version has been implemented as a standalone plugin, providing more flexibility and ease of maintenance, rather than being an integrated component.
- **Centralized Keypair Configuration:** The plugin supports configuration with a single master keypair, simplifying the setup. All payment methods, including Unzer PayLater, can be managed through this single keypair.

### 🔁 Migration Instructions:

1. **Obtain New Master Keypair:** Request a new master keypair that encompasses all desired payment methods.  
   **Install and Configure New Plugin:** Install the new Unzer Payment plugin and configure it using the new master keypair.

2. **Deactivate Payment Methods:** Disable all payment methods associated with the old plugin in the backend to prevent them from appearing in the checkout.

3. **Maintain Configuration of Old Plugin:** Keep the old plugin active with its current configuration. This will allow you to view, refund, and cancel any previous transactions.

4. **Activate New Payment Methods:** Once configured, activate the payment methods through the new plugin so they are visible during checkout.

5. **Support**  
   For any issues or further assistance with the new plugin, please contact our support team at: [support@unzer.com](mailto:support@unzer.com)

> By following these steps, you will be able to transition seamlessly to the new plugin while retaining the ability to manage existing transactions.
